This program will read a find the number of grades, average grade, and

We first read text file
from the text file it will count the amount of grades
then from the text file we sum the grades in total
we % the sum of grades to the amount of grades to find class average
we then compare each grade to class average to see who scored above the average
and sum those that did
with the sum of those above average we % the amount of students to find 
the percentage above class average

once we get our number of grades, average grade, and percent grades above average we display it
